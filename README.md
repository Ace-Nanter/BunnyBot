✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/next:app my-app` to generate an application.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

After generated a library, if `merge-paths:watch` has not already been called, you should run at least `merge-paths` to
update paths in sub-projects.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/js:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@iv4/mylib`.

After generated a library, if `merge-paths:watch` has not already been called, you should run at least `merge-paths` to
update paths in sub-projects.
